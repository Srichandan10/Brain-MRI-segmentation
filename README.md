# Brain-MRI-segmentation
The LGG Segmentation Dataset which is used in this project can be found https://kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation .
Dataset used in:
Mateusz Buda, AshirbaniSaha, Maciej A. Mazurowski "Association of genomic subtypes of lower-grade gliomas with shape features automatically extracted by a deep learning algorithm." Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2019.

This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
